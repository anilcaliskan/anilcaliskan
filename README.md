### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anil! 

I have been working on marketing, SEO and Wordpress since 2015. I've been developing HTML, CSS, Boostrap and some JS projects for several years. I am currently constantly working to become a MERN stack developer. I have also been a music producer for a long time. Between 2010 and 2020, I made dozens of Rap, Trap, Techno and unique music. Apart from my software knowledge, I know and can use professional music programs (Studio One, Logic, FL Studio) well.
